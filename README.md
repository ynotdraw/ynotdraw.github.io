# What's Here

Hi.  I've posted slides on presentations I've done.  Feel free to pull them down or just use GitHub pages to view - the links are below.

## Ember Slides
* [engine-pipelines](https://ynotdraw.github.io/docs/index.html#/) - I talk about build and deployment pipelines for Ember Engines.
* [testing-n-stuff](https://ynotdraw.github.io/testing-n-stuff/index.html#/) - I discuss ember-cli-page-object and ember-test-selectors. Show off very brief examples of why they are great add-ons.  Also share some great testing links.
